<h1>Customer Segmentation Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Python project focuses on customer segmentation analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) profile and the K-means clustering algorithm. RFM analysis helps categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior, specifically their recency of purchase, frequency of purchase, and monetary value. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters. By combining the RFM profile with K-means clustering, this project aims to identify distinct customer segments based on their buying patterns. This information can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, customer retention efforts, and personalized experiences.
